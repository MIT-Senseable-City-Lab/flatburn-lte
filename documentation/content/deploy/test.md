# 🪁 Test
The test plan outlines a procedure for validating the flatburn sensing platform. The device is a Particle-based module with sensors for temperature, humidity, PM, noise, plus GPS, and embedded LTE-M or GPRS within the Particle SOM.

Tests are organized into hardware validation, software validation, system integration, and field drive-by testing.
