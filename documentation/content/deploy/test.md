# ü™Å Test
The test plan outlines a procedure for validating the flatburn sensing platform. The device is a Particle-based module with sensors for temperature, humidity, PM, noise, plus GPS, and embedded LTE-M or GPRS within the Particle SOM.

Tests are organized into hardware validation, software validation, system integration, and field drive-by testing.

# Hardware Validation

### Sensor Functional Testing
Objective: Verify that each sensor powers up and produces reasonable output over its expected range.


### Accuracy and precision validation
Objective: How accurately and precisely does each sensor measure

### GPS Module Testing
Objective: Verify GPS fix, position accuracy under real-world conditions.
