# ðŸ“Š Data retrieval via USB cable

Follow these steps to retrieve data from the Flatburn device using the USB script.
## Step 1: Connect Flatburn to Your Computer
Turn on your Flatburn device.
Use a USB cable to connect the device to your computer.
## Step 2: Run the USB Data Script
Open your terminal and run the script with admin permissions:
sudo python usb_flatburn.py
You will be prompted to enter your password to continue.
## Step 3: Select the USB Port
The script will show a list of available serial ports:

E.g. Available serial ports:
1. /dev/cu.xx - n/a
2. /dev/cu.xx - n/a
3. /dev/cu.xx - n/a
   
**4. /dev/cu.usbmodem3101 - B-SoM CDC Mode** (make this bold)
Enter the number of the port to use:

Identify the Flatburn port (usually says "CDC Mode") and enter the corresponding number (e.g., 4).
## Step 4: Choose Files to Download
The script will show the available files on the SD card, for ex:

Available files:
1. /12052114.CSV
2. /12052130.CSV
3. /12061515.CSV

Youâ€™ll be prompted to select which files to download:

Enter file numbers to download (comma-separated, or 'all')

To download all files, type: all

To download specific files, type their numbers (e.g., 3): 

You'll the see the prompt display:

Downloading /12061515.CSV

Saved: /Users/user/sd_card_downloads/12061515.CSV (63448 bytes)

`Files` are saved to the folder: ~/sd_card_downloads/

## Step 5: Choose Files to Parse
Once files are downloaded, you'll see:
Downloaded files:
1. 12052114.CSV
2. 12052130.CSV
3. 12061515.CSV
   
Youâ€™ll be prompted to select which files to parse (i.e., clean and format for analysis):
Enter file numbers to parse (comma-separated, or 'all'):

To parse all downloaded files, type: all

To parse specific files, type their numbers (e.g., 3):
Parsed and saved: /Users/user/sd_card_downloads/parsed_files/12061515_parsed.csv

Parsed files will be saved to:
~/sd_card_downloads/parsed_files/
Each file is saved with a _parsed.csv suffix.
## Step 6: You're Done!
You now have clean, ready-to-use CSV files containing environmental and telemetry data.
You can now use these files for analysis, upload to cloud storage, or integrate them into your research workflow.
