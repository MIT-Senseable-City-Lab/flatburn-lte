### Sensors

#### Thermal Imaging

Thermal imaging can be used to assess the energy efficiency of building envelopes, monitor infrastructure, and study the impact of anthropogenic heat in the cities (e.g. Urban Heat Island effect).

#### Particulate Matter

![Particulate Matter](@site/static/files/device/particulate.svg)

City Scanner counts particles in different diameter size bins (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) using a small laser. The particle counts are an indicator to determine signatures of different pollution sources. This data can inform epidemiological research and urban health policies.

#### Temperature & Humidity
