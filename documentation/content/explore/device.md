### üì∑ Thermal Imaging

<!-- ![Thermal Imaging](@site/static/files/device/thermal.svg) -->
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/mlx90640.jpg)
    </div>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/DSC_5448.jpg)
    </div>
</div>
_Sensor: MLX90640 (110¬∫ FoV)._

Thermal imaging can be used to assess the energy efficiency of building envelopes, monitor infrastructure, and study the impact of anthropogenic heat in the cities (e.g. Urban Heat Island effect).

The thermal camera is protected by a sealed germanium flat lens, which allows infrared frequencies to be captured.

### üí® Gases

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/alphasense.jpg)
    </div>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/gases.jpg)
    </div>
</div>


_Sensor: Alphasense._

By using Alphasense platform for sensing gases, it is possible to mount up to two different sensors using the same base configuration, such as CO, NO2 or O3.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Particulate Matter

<!-- ![Particulate Matter](@site/static/files/device/particulate.svg) -->
<div style={{width: "49%"}}>
    ![alt text](../../static/files/device/sensirion.jpg)
</div>
_Sensor: Sensirion SPS30._

City Scanner counts particles in different diameter size bins (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10) using a small laser.

The particle counts are an indicator to determine signatures of different pollution sources. This data can inform epidemiological research and urban health policies.

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature & üíß Humidity

<!-- ![Temperature & Humidity](@site/static/files/device/temperature.svg) -->

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/temphum.jpg)
    </div>
</div>

_Sensor: Bosch BME280_

City Scanner includes low-cost temperature and humidity sensors that can be used to understand pedestrian activities as well as heat islands in urban areas.

### üé§ Noise Levels

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/microphone.jpg)
    </div>
</div>

_Sensor: CUI DEVICES CMM-2718AT-42316-TR MEMS Microphone_

The device carries an internal microphone able to capture noise from surroundings.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Position & üöé Road Quality

<!-- ![Road Quality](@site/static/files/device/road.svg) -->

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/gps.jpg)
    </div>
</div>

_Sensor: u-blox NEO-M8U-06B_

The GPS sensor provides location, and also accelerometer data to identify road quality based on the vehicle vibrations.

City Scanner literally creates a roadmap for improving roads.

## Power

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Energy

Whenever the sun is shining the device is able to charge its battery while operating.

### üîã Battery

If either the day is cloudy, or it is in a shade, the device is able to run for _‚ö†Ô∏è N hours_ without needing to charge on an outlet.

## Connectivity

### üåé Particle GSM

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/b404.jpg)
    </div>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/b524.jpg)
    </div>
</div>

By using a [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) module, the device automatically gathers data and send it to the cloud, and might have its firmware updated remotely as well.

It is possible to select between US (B404) and EU (B524), depending on where the device will be deployed.

## Weather Resilience

### ‚òîÔ∏è Sensing Chamber

Inspired by the nasal cavity. Just like our brains, all sensitive electronics are positioned in a monolithic enclosure and above the air intake, avoiding the water entrance.

![alt text](../../static/files/device/DSC_5416.jpg)

The sensors that need to be in contact with the exterior are protected by grilled nostrils that slows the airspeed to avoid misreadings and allows for fast sensor response times. Any eventual accumulated moisture is easily drained through internal slopes.

### ü§ø Sealed I/Os

Both the **on‚Äìoff switch** and the **USB-C port** are sealed for protection while keeping their core functionalities.
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <span style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/DSC_5446.jpg)

    <span style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/DSC_5445.jpg)
    </span>
</div>

The USB-C can be used to charge the device, flash firmware, debug and retrieve data.

    </span>
</div>


## Practicity

### üß≤ Magnetic Mount

The two magnets on the bottom make it easy to **attach the device to any ferromagnetic material**, such as most of automobile roofs.
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"space-between"}}>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/magnets.jpg)
    </div>
    <div style={{width: "49%"}}>
        ![alt text](../../static/files/device/nomagnets.jpg)
    </div>
</div>
Alternatively, the magnets can be removed, leaving the rear standard camera 1/4" thread to **mount the device with other accessories.**

### üíº Light and Compact

Each unit weighs 1.5kg, and at least 5 devices can be fitted inside a small carry-on bag.
