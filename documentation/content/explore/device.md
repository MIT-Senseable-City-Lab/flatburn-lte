## Sensors

### 🌡️ 📷 Thermal Imaging

<!-- ![Thermal Imaging](@site/static/files/device/thermal.svg) -->

Thermal imaging can be used to assess the energy efficiency of building envelopes, monitor infrastructure, and study the impact of anthropogenic heat in the cities (e.g. Urban Heat Island effect).

### 🏭 💨 Particulate Matter

<!-- ![Particulate Matter](@site/static/files/device/particulate.svg) -->

City Scanner counts particles in different diameter size bins (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10) using a small laser.

The particle counts are an indicator to determine signatures of different pollution sources. This data can inform epidemiological research and urban health policies.

### 🌡️ 💧 Temperature & Humidity

<!-- ![Temperature & Humidity](@site/static/files/device/temperature.svg) -->

City Scanner includes low-cost temperature and humidity sensors that can be used to understand pedestrian activities as well as heat islands in urban areas.


### 🚥 🎤 Noise Levels

The device carries an internal microphone able to capture noise from surroundings.


### 🚗 🚎 Road Quality

<!-- ![Road Quality](@site/static/files/device/road.svg) -->

Using accelerometers, City Scanner identifies road quality based on the vehicle vibrations.

City Scanner literally creates a roadmap for improving roads.

## Power

### ☀️ ⚡️ Solar Energy

Whenever the sun is shining the device is able to charge its battery while operating. 

### 🔋 ⚡️ Battery

If either the day is cloudy, or it is in a shade, the device is able to run for *⚠️ N hours* without needing to charge on an outlet.

## Connectivity

### 📡 🌎 Particle GSM

By using a [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) module, the device can automatically gather data and send to a cloud, and even have its firmware updated remotely.
