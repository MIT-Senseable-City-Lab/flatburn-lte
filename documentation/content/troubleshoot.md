# Troubleshoot


## LED Indicators
The Flatburn environmental sensing platform includes multiple onboard LEDs that serve different roles. Proper understanding and use of these indicators can help during deployment, diagnostics, and field maintenance.
## Main RGB LED â€“ Particle connectivity status
This LED is part of the built-in RGB LED for the particle module (e.g, Boron)
Behavior (default, unless overridden):

ðŸŸ¢ Breathing Cyan: Connected to Particle Cloud

ðŸŸ¡ Blinking Yellow: Listening mode (waiting for setup)

ðŸ”´ Blinking Red: Error state (number of blinks = error code)

âšª Off: Device off or LED turned off in firmware

More information here: https://docs.particle.io/troubleshooting/led/

## Red LED â€“ Charging Status
This is a dedicated red LED located near the power management circuit.
It indicates the deviceâ€™s charging state:

ðŸ”´ On: The device is currently charging

âšª Off: Charging is complete, or no power is supplied from either the solar or the USB charging

## Second RGB LED â€“ System Status
This is a secondary RGB LED on the Flatburn board, separate from the built-in Particle RGB LED. 

ðŸŸ¢ Solid Green: All sensors responding; normal operation

ðŸŸ¡ Blinking Yellow: Temporary error (e.g., GPS searching, network retrying)

ðŸ”´ Solid Red: Critical error (e.g., sensor failure, not temp data, or pm data)

This would give quick visual insight into the systemâ€™s state.
