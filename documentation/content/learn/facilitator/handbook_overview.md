# ðŸŽˆ Overview

This **Python coding activity** aims to provide users with background information and context on mobile air quality monitoring and environmental sensing, as well as teach coding skills and analysis techniques, including:

- Using popular Python libraries such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to interact with data;
- Creating time series graphs of measurements of environmental phenomena;
- Creating python-based web maps using the Python [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) library.

The handbook is composed of three parts:

- **Two facilitator guides:** meant to support an individual or teaching team in combining these resources to deliver during a class or workshop. One version for a [Python notebook](./facilitator/handbook_python) that can be run in an environment of your choice, another to aid the facilitation of a [Google Colab](./facilitator/handbook_colab) activity.
- **Workshop slides:** an educational presentation on the background of environmental sensing, mobile air quality monitoring, and the [CityScanner](../explore/platform) platform.
