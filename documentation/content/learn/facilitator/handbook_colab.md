### During the Workshop Introduction

Provide students with the link to the zip file containing the notebook and relevant data files:

- Ask the students to download the zip file onto their computer, and unzip the files.
- Then, ask them to upload the folder to their Google Drive and rename the folder ‚ÄúTHEIRNAME_WorkshopName‚Äù. The path to get to the folder should be ‚Äò/content/drive/My Drive/THEIRNAME_WorkshopName.
- Ask the students to modify the path in Block 4 to reflect this During the Workshop
- When the students run code block #13, which creates the first .html map, let them know that the .html file will be saved in the Google Drive folder they created. - They will need to download the file onto their computers and then double click to open it in their web browser and interact with it.
- Please ensure they know which location they are saving the .html file to (eg, Desktop or Downloads folder).
