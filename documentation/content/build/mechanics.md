### Material and Suggested Settings

The easiest material to print with is _PLA_, but _ASA_ is recommended for prolonged outdoor use with high exposure to weather.

It is important to choose a **light material** (i.e. white) to avoid overheating when exposed to sun, which might interfere with measurements and overall electronics' life-cycle.

Since the device might also be exposed to moisture, vibration and stress â€“ during trips and mounting/unmounting â€“ it is recommended to print with settings that provide sturdyness and plenty layer and walls sealing:

- **_layer height_ â€“ 0.28mm**
- **_top layers_ â€“ 5**
- **_bottom layers_ â€“ 5**
- **_walls_ â€“ 5**
- **_infill_ â€“ 15%**

These settings were used for time estimations below, with a total time of approximately **15 hours**.

### Supports

### Parts List

:::warning
Both _middle_ and _camera_ are the only parts that need supports.

:::tip
The 3d files below are provided with optimal orientation for printing, which is different from their respective reference images.
