:::info
It is highly reccommended that you read this entire assembly manual to familiarize yourself before starting!
:::

## Overview

The assembly process consists of **20 easy steps**, which should take up to **60 minutes** per device.

You will be melting brass inserts into plastic, placing parts together, connecting cables and fastening screws.

The device was designed for not needing wire soldering or any complex operation.

### Safety & Tips

:::danger

1. Be aware of the soldering iron tip and hot parts to **avoid burning** yourself and the 3d printed parts.
2. The metal inserts will keep **hot for a while** after inserting, especially the bigger 1/4" ones.
   :::

:::tip

- It is easy to misplace the inserts, pay attention to the **indicated spots** on the images.
- The **larger holes** are meant for the **1/4 inserts**, the **medium M3** and **smaller M2**.
- After the inserts are melted into the plastic they **cannot be easily removed** without damaging the 3d printed part.

## Step 8 ‚Äì Battery and Main Board

Place the battery on the _top_ piece, making sure the cable orientation follows the image:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5239.jpg)

<!-- ![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5238.jpg) -->

Then, add the _battery_cover_:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5241.jpg)

<!-- ![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5240.jpg) -->

Now, pick the Main Board and connect the battery cable:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5243.jpg)

To insert the Main Board into the _top_ piece, first place its front with at an angle:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5244.jpg)

Finally, lower and then slide it back:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5245.jpg)

## Step 9 ‚Äì Secure Main Board

For fixing the Main Board, pick 4x M2 washers and put each into 4x M2X6 screws
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5246.jpg)

<!-- ![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5247.jpg) -->

Fasten them into the four indicated holes:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5248.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5250.jpg)

## Step 10 ‚Äì Thermal Camera

:::warning
Be careful to not touch or scratch the lens (reflective dot inside the black cylinder).
:::

Start by placing the MLX9640 module into the _camera_ piece while paying attention to the correct orientation on the image:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5254.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5255.jpg)

Now, combine 4x M2X6 screws with 4x M2 washers and place them into the four indicated spots:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5256.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5257.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5258.jpg)

To install the camera module, start by placing the O-ring inside the _top_ piece, making sure it is well aligned to the receptacle:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5261.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5262.jpg)

Then, You should angle the device and **very carefully** place the germanium lens on top of the O-ring by holding it by its edges.

It will be intentionally loose, because there will be pressure between the germanium lens, the O-ring and the _top_ piece to make the set watertight after securing the module.
:::tip
Do not touch any of the faces of the lens because this will compromise its imaging performance.

If you eventually do so, please clean it with a microfiber cloth.
:::

![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5263.jpg)

Take advantage of the already angled device to slide the camera module in, and then hold it steadily in place while inserting 1x M2x6 screw into the left hole (the front is reserved for an M3 screw that will be used later)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5265.jpg)

Keep holding the module while fastening the screw:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5267.jpg)

Now, fasten 2xM2x6 screws on the superior area.
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5269.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5270.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5271.jpg)

## Step 11 ‚Äì Solar Panel

Align the panel to make sure the cable is going out backwards, then pass its cable through the hole:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5272.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5273.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5276.jpg)

There are six holes to secure the solar panel to the _top_ piece. Now, pick up 6x M3X16 screws + 6x M3 washers and 6x 5mm spacers.

![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5278.jpg)

The correct order is **screw ‚Üí washer ‚Üí Solar Panel ‚Üí spacer ‚Üí _top_ piece**:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5280.jpg)

Start with both the intermeriary spots, since that will make it easier to align the Solar Panel to the _top_ piece:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5282.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5283.jpg)

Proceed to the corners:
:::tip
Due to variation of tolerances, it might be harder to fasten these corner screws.

Make sure the screw is properly aligned to the insert on the _top_ piece and fasten while making sure it is following the right angle.
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5284.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5285.jpg)

Please make sure there is no surplus of cable above the _top_ piece, all excess should be below:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5286.jpg)

Gently wind the cable while making sure it enters through the indicated spot on the back of the _top_ piece and respects the boundaries of its compartment above the _battery_holder_:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5287.jpg)

Attach the connector to the Main Board socket:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5288.jpg)

## Step 12 ‚Äì Sensing Board

:::info
Depending on your needs, choose the appropriate gas sensor: CO+NO2 or O3+NO2 (depicted).

More information [here](https://).
:::

First, start by assembling the desired Alphasense AFE board module into the Sensor Board:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5289.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5292.jpg)
:::warning
Make sure the module is properly aligned, because it is easy to attach it wrong.

The module sides must be parallel, and aligned to the Sensing Board edges.
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5293.jpg)

To place the Sensing Board into the _top_ piece, fit it into the back part while keeping it angled:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5294.jpg)

Swing it down, while paying attention to the fitting on the left side:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5295.jpg)

Finally, slide the Sensing Board away, making sure the Solar Panel cable is on the proper place:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5296.jpg)

To secure the Sensing Board, pick 1x M3X16 screw with 1x M3 washer and fasten it into the right hole.
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5297.jpg)
:::warning
Do not fasten the screw excessively or you might damage the Sensing Board.

It should be enough just for the Sensing Board to be held at place
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5299.jpg)

Finally, pick 1x M2X6 screw with 1x M2 washer to de fastened on the left hole.
:::tip
This is trickier since the screw needs to be put underneath the Alphasense AFE board.

You can raise it a little bit if needed, making sure it doesn't get disconnected.
:::

![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5301.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5303.jpg)

## Step 13 ‚Äì Main Cable

The main cable connects the Main Board with the Sensing Board.

:::tip
The cable has no specific start or end, but its connectors has only one way to be inserted.
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5304.jpg)

First, connect the cable to the Sensing Board:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5307.jpg)

Then, connect the cable to the Main Board:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5308.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5309.jpg)

To organize the cables, place them underneath the Alphasense AFE board.

![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5344.jpg)
:::tip
You might carefully use a tweezer or screwdriver to gently push the connector, but take care to not damage anything.
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5345.jpg)

Finally, connect the cable to the Sensing Board:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5346.jpg)

## Step 15 ‚Äì Switch

Place the _switch_bottom_ into the _middle_ piece, from below:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5313.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5314.jpg)

Insert the o-ring into the _switch_top_, observing if it is perfectly fitting into its recess:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5316.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5317.jpg)

Align, then join the _switch_top_ and _switch_bottom_ with 1x M2X6 screw while keeping the _middle_ piece in between:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5319.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5320.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5323.jpg)
:::info
The switch must move freely between start and end, but there should be no play between the three parts.
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5324.jpg)

## Step 16 ‚Äì USB-C Cable

Pick the _Waterproof USB-C cable_:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5325.jpg)

Now, unscrew the cap and nut, remove them completely leaving the rubber seal, then put it back:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5326.jpg)

Place the cable in the appropriate place:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5327.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5328.jpg)

Turn the _middle_ piece around and add the cap-holding ring, leaving its strip pointing to the right.
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5329.jpg)

Fasten the nut while keeping the cap strip at the same position:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5330.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5331.jpg)

Screw the cap:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5332.jpg)

Connect the 90¬∫ usb-c adapter to the _Waterproof USB-C cable_:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5333.jpg)

Twist the cable as indicated, this will help avoiding collision with other parts when finishing the assembly:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5335.jpg)

## Step 17 ‚Äì Particulate Sensor

:::tip
Pay attention to the correct orientation, since there are several ways for assembling it wrong.
:::
Place the Sensirion sensor into its craddle on the _middle_ piece:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5337.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5338.jpg)

Attach the cable to the Sensirion sensor:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5339.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5340.jpg)

:::tip
If you need, use a tweezer or screwdriver to help attaching the sensor properly to the end.
:::
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5341.jpg)

To allow for the _middle_ piece to be attached to the _top_ piece correctly, align the switch longitudinally:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5347.jpg)

And push the Main Board switch to the right:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5348.jpg)

Roll the Sensirion cable to remove the excess and connect it to the indicate spot:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5350.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5351.jpg)

**‚úÖ Result**
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5352.jpg)

## Step 18 ‚Äì Closing

Connect the 90¬∫ USB-C Adapter to the Main Board:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5353.jpg)

With care, align the _middle_ and _top_ pieces together while respecting the switch position:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5354.jpg)

:::warning
Now you **must move back the switch** counter-clockwise to turn the device off.
:::

Fasten 3x M3x16 screws, joining the middle and top pieces together:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5356.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5358.jpg)
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5359.jpg)

Position the _bottom_ piece over the _top_ and _middle_ pieces:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5360.jpg)

Keep the cap strip out of the way:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5361.jpg)

Then insert it into the appropriate entrance on the right:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5362.jpg)

Place the last 4x M3x16 screws into the four bottom openings:
![alt text](../../static/files/assembly/DSC_5363.jpg)

Fasten to hold it together with middle and top pieces:
:::tip
Due to the angles it might be more dificult than usual to fasten the screws.

It helps if each one is tightened a bit at a time, instead of fixing one at once.
